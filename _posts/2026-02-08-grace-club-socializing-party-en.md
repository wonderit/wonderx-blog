## The Temperature of a Saturday

4:30 PM. I walked out of the OPIc testing center near Gangnam Station. My head was still cluttered with half-formed English sentences.

After an exam, the instinct is to go home. But I drove to Sinchon instead. There was a Grace Club socializing party at 6. Entry fee: 100,000 KRW. Venue: Nogosan Studio.

The drive to meet strangers felt more nerve-wracking than the drive to take a test.

## Changcheon Public Parking Lot

I needed to park in Sinchon. I found my way to **Changcheon Public Parking Lot** — a place I'd been once before for an LST English study meetup.

Second visit, still unfamiliar. I parked and stood in front of the restroom mirror. Brushed my teeth. Straightened my coat. Slipped hand warmers into my pockets.

The wind hit my face the moment I stepped outside. Five minutes of walking. February in Sinchon felt colder than any number could describe.

I arrived at 5:55 PM.

Coming alone meant there was nobody to share my pre-party heartbeat with. Maybe it was the cold. The nerves felt strangely like warmth.

## The Venue — A Renovated House

Finding the place wasn't easy. Naver Maps couldn't quite locate it.

Turns out it was **a regular house converted into a studio**. A small two-story home dressed in antique decor. It could fit 30 to 40, but only about 20 showed up.

The quirky part: **you had to take your shoes off**. Natural for a residential house, but the sight of formally dressed adults piling coats and heels in a corner was quietly funny.

The dress code was **formal, business**. Everyone arrived in coats, skirts, polished and put-together. But standing there in stockinged feet, elegance and intimacy coexisted in a strange way.

Some stood around tall tables. Others gathered on clusters of antique chairs.

## The Early Birds

When I walked in, about 6 men and 2 women were already there.

The unwritten rule of parties: arriving early means enduring awkwardness. I was on the awkward side.

The tall man beside me turned out to work in **manufacturing**. His major was electrical engineering, close to mine. Without a word, we reached a silent agreement — "let's stick together" — and drifted one step away from the main table.

As more people trickled in, my ears started going numb. By then, I'd given my self-introduction **at least six times**. With each repetition, the introduction got shorter.

"Want to head upstairs?" Someone pointed to the second floor. Just as I was about to move, another person threw out the ideal type question.

I said, "I like someone with bright, sharp eyes." Even as the words left my mouth, I wasn't sure I meant them.

## The Whisper Game

Upstairs, we were talking. Over the railing, I could see the first floor below. A man and a woman who looked like a couple were deep in conversation.

"Mind if we join?" They said sure.

The group swelled past eight. A **whisper game** started naturally. Someone picked me, handed over a sip, and leaned in close: "Who here do you think has the best vibe?"

I hadn't expected party games at a socializing event. But a stranger's whisper hits the chest harder than you'd think.

## Someone Who Caught My Eye

Then a new person walked in.

Honestly? **No initial attraction.** Not my type, looks-wise.

But her self-introduction changed something. Young, studious, clearly sharp. There was a steadiness in the way she spoke, word by word.

"Maybe I'll talk to her."

She'd picked me during the whisper game, so courage came easier. I asked where she lived.

**Same neighborhood — Songpa.**

"Instead of doing the big group thing, why don't we just talk, the two of us?" And just like that, we slipped out of the party.

## Round Two — Songri-dan-gil

The second spot was a **cafe-lounge in Songri-dan-gil**. Low lighting, quiet music. Comfortable.

They had **petit fours** on the menu. "I'm coming back for those," I thought. That kind of idle resolution is proof of comfort.

We ordered:
- Butter potato bites
- Chicken & fries
- Non-alcoholic sangria (for her)
- Zero Coke (for me)

The longer we talked, the more the conversation branched sideways. English tutoring stories, college days, TOEIC exams. One topic kept splitting into the next.

Then the topic of **execution** came up.

## "You Have Real Execution Power"

She was telling me about her tutoring experiences, so I offered mine.

At 20, I walked out of the TOEIC exam hall and scribbled on the desk: **"[University] student was here. 010-XXXX-XXXX."** Someone actually called. That's how I ended up tutoring English for students two years younger.

When something enters my head, I can't rest until I act on it. The OPIc test itself — I signed up two days before, on a Thursday, thinking "I've got nothing this weekend, what should I do?"

After hearing that, she said: **"You have real execution power."**

That single sentence stayed with me longer than it should have. Being recognized felt good.

## Better Done Than Perfect

There's a phrase in English that captures this:

**"Better done than perfect."**

Don't spend time preparing perfectly. Just do it.

It's something I tell my team all the time. Sitting there in that lounge, I saw it confirmed again. While you wait for perfect, the moment passes.

## Home at 1 AM

We finished at 1 AM.

I sat in the car for a moment. One exam, one party, one person. A full Saturday.

## But the 15-Second Rule Was Right After All

There's a saying: **"You can judge a person in the first 15 seconds."**

I used to think that was wrong. That you should look deeper. That first impressions lie.

This time, I confirmed it. **It was right.**

Looks get you past the first round. After that, personality, background, career — those come into view.

That night, the conversation flowed easily. I thought we were clicking. The laughter came naturally. The silence wasn't uncomfortable.

But my heart wasn't racing.

Comfort and spark were different doors.

## We Met One More Time

After that night, we met once more. Just in case. Maybe time would change things.

I forced myself to give it another shot.

But my heart stayed quiet.

**The 15-second rule was right all along.**

## The Little Things

During our conversations, she noticed my small details — the four-leaf clover keyring on the car mount, the Daniel Troost Bombshell fragrance, the diffuser ring.

A person who notices the small things is a good person. That much is clear.

But in the hours when she wasn't there, I didn't think of her.
