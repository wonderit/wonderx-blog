## Saturday Schedule

Around 4:30 PM. I left the OPIc testing center near Gangnam Station.

Straight from the exam, I headed to Sinchon. There was a Grace Club socializing party at 6 PM.

Entry fee: 100,000 KRW. Venue: Nogosan Studio.

## Changcheon Public Parking Lot

I needed to park in Sinchon. I remembered a place I'd been to once before when I attended an LST English study group — **Changcheon Public Parking Lot**.

Second time here, but it still didn't feel familiar. After parking, I brushed my teeth in the restroom and straightened out my outfit. Grabbed some hand warmers too.

It was cold. The five-minute walk to the venue cut right through me.

I arrived at 5:55 PM.

Coming alone, I had nobody to share my pre-party heart rate with.

Maybe it was the cold. The nervousness actually felt kind of warming.

## The Venue — A Renovated House

Finding the place was tricky. Naver Maps wasn't much help.

Turns out it was **a regular house converted into a studio**. A small two-story home with antique-style decor throughout.

It could probably fit 30 to 40 people. In reality, about 20 showed up.

The quirky part? **You had to take your shoes off.** Makes sense for a residential house, but the sight of everyone's coats and shoes piled up in one corner was pretty funny.

The dress code was basically **formal, business casual**. Everyone showed up in coats, skirts, looking elegant and put-together.

Instead of sitting on the floor, people were either standing around tall tables or gathered on clusters of antique chairs.

## The Early Birds

When I walked in, there were about 6 men and 2 women.

Classic party rule: showing up early always feels awkward. I just stood there, not sure what to do with myself.

The tall guy next to me turned out to work in **manufacturing**. His major was electrical engineering — pretty similar to mine.

We silently agreed to "stick together" and drifted away from the main table to hang on the side.

After a while, my ears started going numb. By that point, I'd given my self-introduction **at least six times**.

Just as someone said "Wanna head upstairs?", someone else threw out the ideal type question.

I answered: "I like someone with bright, sharp eyes."

## The Whisper Game

We went upstairs and started chatting. From the second floor, I could see a good-looking pair downstairs — a man and a woman deep in conversation, looking like a couple already.

"Mind if we join?" They said sure, so we pulled up.

The group quickly grew to 8+ people, and somehow we ended up playing a **whisper game**.

Someone picked me and slipped me a sip of a drink, then whispered something like: "Who here do you think has the best vibe?" That kind of question.

I didn't expect party games at a socializing event, but honestly? It was more fun than I thought.

## Someone Caught My Eye

Then a new person walked in.

Honestly? **No initial attraction.**

Not my type, looks-wise.

But when she introduced herself, I noticed she was quite young and clearly studious — she came across as sharp and grounded.

Something solid about her.

"Might as well talk to her."

She'd picked me during the whisper game, so I worked up the courage to start a conversation.

I asked where she lived. **Same neighborhood — Songpa.**

"Instead of doing the whole group second-round thing, why don't we just talk, the two of us?" And just like that, we headed to a second location.

## Round Two — Songri-dan-gil

The second spot was a **cafe-lounge in Songri-dan-gil**.

It was chill and comfortable. They had **petit fours** on the menu, and I thought, "Definitely coming back for those."

We ordered:
- Butter potato bites
- Chicken & fries
- Non-alcoholic sangria (for her)
- Zero Coke (for me)

The longer we talked, the more the conversation kept veering into random tangents.

English tutoring stories, college days, TOEIC exam stories...

And then we got to the topic of **execution**.

## "Execution Is Everything"

She was telling me about her tutoring experiences, so I shared mine.

When I was 20, after finishing the TOEIC exam, I wrote on the desk on my way out: **"[University name] student was here. 010-XXXX-XXXX"** — just like that.

Someone actually called.

I ended up tutoring English for students two years younger than me.

When something pops into my head, I just do it. That's the same reason I signed up for the OPIc exam — two days before, on a Thursday, I was thinking "I've got nothing going on this weekend, what should I do?" and just registered.

She told me I had **"real execution power."**

It felt good to be recognized for that.

## Better Done Than Perfect

There's a phrase in English that captures this:

**"Better done than perfect."**

Don't waste time trying to prepare perfectly. Just do it.

It's something I tell my team all the time, and hearing it validated in this context reinforced it once more.

## Home at 1 AM

We wrapped up at 1 AM.

Talked until then, then headed home.

## But the 15-Second Rule Was Right After All

There's a saying: **"You can judge a person in the first 15 seconds."**

I used to think that was wrong.

This time, I confirmed it. **It's right.**

Looks get you past the first screening round. After that, personality, background, career — those come into focus.

That night, the conversation flowed easily. I thought we were clicking.

But my heart wasn't racing.

## We Met One More Time

After that night, we met up once more.

Just in case, I forced myself to give it another shot.

But still — no heartbeat.

**The 15-second rule was right all along.**

## The Little Things

During our conversations, she noticed the little details — the four-leaf clover keyring on my car mount, the Daniel Troost Bombshell fragrance, the diffuser ring.

I liked that she paid attention to the small stuff.

But I never found myself thinking about her when she wasn't around.
