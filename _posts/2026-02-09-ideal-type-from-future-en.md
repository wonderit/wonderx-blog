Monday evening, Gangnam.

I went to an English study group. Two topics for the night: "What's your ideal type?" and "What inspires you?" Common questions. I've answered them maybe seventeen times on blind dates, each time differently. And yet, every time, I notice I've changed a little since the last answer.

Tonight was no different.

## A Frequency Called Eye Light

"What's your ideal type?"

Most guys say "someone fair-skinned and kind." Most women say "someone sweet who works on self-improvement." These aren't wrong answers. But they're not ideal types. They're spec sheets.

Lately, I answer like this:

"Someone with good eye light."

I know it sounds abstract. So I add: someone who's like Egen on the outside and Teto on the inside. Someone fun to be around. Someone I could date like a best friend.

But what is eye light, really? I've been thinking about it.

Bright eyes aren't simply a matter of looks. Someone who knows their own state and can control it carries a certain frequency in their gaze. A person who sees the world positively has a sparkle. The amplitude of their gaze is wider. The frequency is higher, maybe.

To have good eye light, you have to know yourself. How do you manage stress? What state are you in right now? Someone who doesn't know that has cloudy eyes. No matter how beautiful their face.

The eyes of someone who loves themselves are different.

## When the Rose-Colored Glasses Come Off

One study member had gone on a speed blind date during lunch. I asked for a first impression.

"His face was fun, so that was nice."

Everyone laughed. A fun face. She meant he was absurdly handsome.

But I thought of something else. Someone who holds the door for a stranger. Someone who presses the "open" button in the elevator and waits. Those small acts are what make my heart skip. Green flags of clear character.

There's an expression in English for this:

> "The rose-colored glasses wear off."

The shelf life of looks is short. No matter how fun someone's face is, what remains is whether they held the door or not.

## Someone Who Has Thought About Death

When conversations go deeper, I bring this up:

"I like someone who has thought seriously about death."

The mood suddenly turns into a philosophy seminar. But I mean it.

Heidegger called humans "Being-toward-death" (Sein zum Tode). People who understand the finiteness of life live today differently. When you carry the sensation that tomorrow might not come, you become grateful for small things, focused on what matters, and you speak first to the people you love.

Someone who has seriously contemplated death even once has different eyes.

That's where the eye light is.

## A Person from the Future

"Who inspires you?"

I named Jensen Huang and Elon Musk. Predictable, maybe. But what I admire isn't their success. It's their perspective.

Most people calculate the future from today. With this salary, I can save this much in five years. But visionaries work in reverse. They live today as "the past" seen from a future they've already reached. The direction of time is different.

Imagination before action is planning. Imagination without action is daydreaming. The difference comes down to what you do today.

I call people with that sensibility "people from the future." Those who reverse-engineer today from a future they've already arrived at. I love that vibe.

My ideal type is, in the end, someone like that. Good eye light. Aware of death. A person from the future.

## Today's Input

The study leader recommended a book. Maggie Nelson's *Bluets*. She described it as 240 pieces of prose poetry about the color blue. I should order it.

Today, I met new people, received new questions, and crafted new answers. Input creates output. And output creates the future.

I haven't found my person from the future yet. Maybe I need to become one first.
