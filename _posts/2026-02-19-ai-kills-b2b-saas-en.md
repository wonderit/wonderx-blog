Take a look at your monthly subscription list.

Notion, Slack, HubSpot, Jira, Salesforce, Figma, Zendesk... A lightweight startup stack alone can run into millions of won per month. We treated this as the cost of doing business — until Jensen Huang flipped the table.

> "If a company has AI, it doesn't need SaaS."
> — Jensen Huang, Davos 2025

At the time, it sounded like the typical bold talk from a tech titan. Less than two years later, it's playing out in concrete terms.

## What Has SaaS Actually Been Doing?

Strip away the marketing and B2B SaaS is simple: **replacing specific workflows with software.**

- Salesforce → sales team manages customer data
- HubSpot → marketing automation + CRM
- Jira → engineering project management
- Zendesk → customer support ticketing

These products dominated for decades for good reason. No developers needed, rich feature sets, and they became de facto global standards. But that foundation is cracking.

## How AI Agents Are Eating SaaS

Here's what's actually happening on the ground.

**Scenario 1: Custom CRM**

Old way → Sign an enterprise Salesforce contract. Customization requires separate consulting fees.
AI way → Tell an agent "manage customer data according to our sales pipeline" and you're done. A CRM tailored to your exact workflow, built on demand.

**Scenario 2: Customer Support Automation**

Old way → Zendesk subscription + manual ticket routing rules.
AI way → An AI agent reads customer messages, categorizes them, and drafts responses. No Zendesk required.

**Scenario 3: Internal Documentation**

Old way → Notion team plan.
AI way → AI auto-generates meeting notes, searches documents, summarizes. It often does this better than the SaaS it replaces.

Here's the key insight. What SaaS has done = **process work through a fixed, predetermined interface**. AI agents have no fixed interface. They understand context and adapt to how your organization actually works. No subscription required.

## The Skill That Matters — Vibe

This is where Jensen Huang's point lands. The ability to use AI tools is already table stakes. The real differentiator now is **the intuition to know which direction to go.**

Say your team gets this request:

> "Our onboarding process is too complicated. Can we automate it?"

How do you solve it?

- Buy a new HR SaaS? → Monthly fees, migration cost from existing workflows
- Add an AI bot to existing Slack? → Fast, keeps familiar environment
- Build a dedicated AI agent? → Fully custom, upfront cost but better long-term
- Just document it as a checklist? → Honestly, sometimes this is the right answer

**The people who win are the ones who find the right answer fast.** Not the ones who know how to use every tool — the ones who know which tool to use and when. That's vibe.

For developers specifically: the old bottleneck was "how do I implement this?" The new bottleneck is "should I implement this at all, or is there a smarter direction?"

## It's Already Showing Up in the Job Market

Think about it from the company's perspective.

If one engineer with strong AI skills can build what three engineers used to in a fraction of the time — obviously you hire that one. Even at a premium, it's a better deal.

This isn't abstract. Silicon Valley job postings now routinely list "AI tool proficiency" as a hard requirement. Some startups are doing take-home challenges that amount to: **"Build us a working MVP using AI. Solo. Come back in a week."**

For job seekers, the reality is blunt.

**One person's worth of output isn't enough anymore.** The people who survive are the ones who can deliver two or three times the results in the same hours. And that doesn't just mean "prompting ChatGPT well." It means knowing what to delegate to AI and what needs a human brain.

## Capabilities: What Survives vs. What Gets Replaced

| Role | Status | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| Repetitive coding, CRUD implementation | High risk | AI is faster and more consistent |
| Writing specs and documentation | High risk | Structured tasks are AI's strength |
| Setting problem direction (vibe) | Essential | AI can't judge this |
| System design and architecture | Essential | Requires context + tradeoff reasoning |
| Team coordination and trust-building | Essential | Relationship-based by nature |
| Designing and operating AI agents | Growth area | The new core skill |

The skill of *using* SaaS → losing value.
The skill of *designing AI that replaces* SaaS → becoming central.

## Conclusion: What Should You Actually Do Right Now

One sentence: **Don't just become someone who uses AI. Become someone who knows what AI should do.**

Concretely:

1. **List everything in your work that AI could replace** — then actually replace it
2. **Pick one SaaS subscription and try replacing it with an AI agent** — direct experience builds vibe
3. **Think in outputs, not hours** — not "I work 8 hours a day" but "this is what I can ship"

The B2B SaaS market will look completely different in 5 to 10 years. More than half of current players will either disappear or transform beyond recognition. Whether that's a crisis or an opportunity depends entirely on which direction you start moving today.

What I'm watching most closely right now is how the boundary between developers and non-developers is dissolving. When AI lets non-engineers build their own tools, what companies start demanding from developers shifts — from coding ability to systems thinking.

That systems thinking — vibe — is the most valuable thing you can develop right now.
