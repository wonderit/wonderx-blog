There's someone who watched the B2B SaaS playbook die from the inside. Noh Jung-seok, a six-time founder currently running a beauty tech company. Google veteran, successful exit with Five Rocks (mobile analytics), and famously the protagonist of a college hacking incident at POSTECH. His recent interview on D-Times cut right to the bone.

> "The B2B SaaS formula — package it up, charge monthly — it's not going to work anymore. Customers already know they don't need it."

We've all heard the "SaaS is dying" narrative. But this person is actively replacing SaaS functions inside his own company. This isn't theory. It's a field report.

## The Frontier Model Game Is Over

Let's start with Noh's diagnosis of where AI stands.

Last year, the market obsession was simple: how far can frontier LLM performance go? Tracking datasets, algorithms, and compute infrastructure was what mattered.

That game is over. The direction shifted this year.

The key concept is **RLVR** (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards). Domains where you can automatically verify if an answer is right or wrong — coding, math — the models already absorbed those. Physics, chemistry, and biology are expected to fall this year.

So where did people run? To **domains where the reward signal can be monopolized**.

Concrete example: an OpenAI alumni lab doing superconductor materials science. The LLM generates candidate materials. A cloud lab with robots runs actual experiments. Results feed back as rewards. They're building an evaluation pipeline that connects the digital world to the physical world — and monopolizing it.

> "The only remaining frontier is domains where you can monopolize the evaluation pipeline."

Pull this down to the AI application layer, and it's the Wild West.

## Why SaaS Really Dies — The Last Mile

Here's what Noh is actually doing inside his company. **Turning it into an autonomous operation.**

He calls it an "autonomous company." This year he refined the term: FSM — Full Self Management.

The method is brutally simple. When someone quits, he used to hire a replacement. Now he steps in himself. He maps the process and invariably finds: **80% is fetching, sending, or organizing data from other systems.** The core value-creating work is less than 20%.

He codes the 80% himself. Vibe coding, Codex, Claude — whatever works. The remaining 20% of judgment calls he handles directly.

> "Companies where the CEO does the actual work will be incredibly powerful in the AI era. Companies where the CEO doesn't — they'll disappear."

The crucial concept is the **last mile**. Every company's operational processes are different. Financial connections, customer support flows, marketing pipelines — these details are invisible unless you're the one doing the work.

Packaging this as SaaS? Impossible. The last mile is different for every company. Consulting? Doesn't scale. You just give away your knowledge.

What remains? **Founders who code their own last mile.**

## The Vibe Coding Reality — It Didn't Even Last 3 Months

There was a vibe coding startup boom late last year. "Use AI to code SaaS products!" Thousands jumped in.

Less than three months later, reality hit.

> "The customers started doing their own work themselves."

Customers began automating their own workflows with AI. They'd buy a vibe-coded product, then layer their own customizations on top, gradually becoming independent. Prices kept dropping. Products became commodities.

Every time a big tech company hosts an AI developer event, thousands of startups collapse in the background. This cycle is now measured in weeks, not months.

The old startup advantage — hoarding good engineers, building technical assets — was the equivalent of owning more factories, more electricity, more workers in the industrial age. That advantage is evaporating.

## The End of Outsourced Development

I've been feeling this too. The era of handing off features to a dev team or calling an SI vendor when you need something built — it's ending.

What Jensen Huang called "vibe" — the intuition to know which direction solves a problem most efficiently — now matters more than coding ability. In a world where AI handles the coding, the real bottleneck is the judgment of *what* to build.

Think about it from the company side. Obviously they'll want people who are good with AI *and* have sharp intuition. From the job seeker's perspective? **Being a one-person's-worth employee isn't competitive anymore.** The new baseline expectation is someone who can deliver 2-3x output by leveraging AI effectively.

As Noh puts it, "the cost of communicating with people is dramatically higher than communicating with AI." So the rational move? Work directly with AI. Cut out the middle layers.

## The Last Surviving Job: Entrepreneur

When asked which jobs would disappear and which would survive in the AI era, Noh's answer was crystal clear.

> "The only thing humans can do is exercise willpower. 'I need to do this' — that's the only role left for humans. It's the entrepreneur. That's our last remaining profession."

And the follow-up was even more striking.

> "We're entering a society where only people who don't need a job are the ones who succeed at getting one."

Translation: people who can independently create value anywhere — only they survive in the job market. The paradox is that companies want to hire exactly the kind of person who doesn't need to be hired.

Elon Musk's stubborn insistence is why rockets land, electric cars drive, and autonomous vehicles exist. Without that one person's pure willpower, none of that future would have arrived. Technology doesn't create the future. Willpower does.

## Noh's Operational Playbook

Here's how Noh actually runs his company (Amelie & Keep):

| Area | Method |
|------|--------|
| Replacing departures | CEO enters the process directly instead of hiring |
| Task analysis | Separate into 80% transaction/organizing + 20% value judgment |
| Automating the 80% | Vibe coding + Codex, built by the CEO |
| The 20% judgment | CEO handles directly |
| External channels | Barely used. Built internal pipeline |
| Internal AI | Built 'Nova' — autonomous management system |

The core insight is about communication cost. Communicating with people costs dramatically more than communicating with AI. The rational choice is for the founder to work directly with AI.

> "The cost of communicating with people — explaining to someone, having them delegate — is too high. My communication cost with AI is radically lower."

---

## What to Do Right Now

Synthesizing Noh's perspective into action items:

1. **Code your own last mile** — Don't outsource to SaaS. Automate it yourself. You'll discover the real operational details in the process
2. **Calculate your communication cost** — If explaining something to a person takes 30 minutes but an AI can do it in 5, the answer is already obvious
3. **Install the entrepreneur mindset** — Jobs aren't disappearing; the definition of a job is changing. Only people with the conviction "I need to do this" survive
4. **Don't sell vibe coding as a service** — Customers will do it themselves soon. Instead, target the tacit knowledge in last-mile processes that customers can't access

The end of B2B SaaS also means **the golden age of solo founders and micro-teams** is beginning. The tools are already sufficient. The only thing missing is the willpower to choose a direction.
