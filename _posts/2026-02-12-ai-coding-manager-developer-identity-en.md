Wednesday night. One of my developer friends works at WeWork, so we met in the lobby for coffee. Mid-conversation, I suddenly went quiet.

They were discussing Claude Code's sub-agents. Something about LSP, delegate mode. I nodded along, but inside, a strange unfamiliarity was growing.

What am I, exactly?

## The Question I Always Hear on Blind Dates

"You're an AI developer? Which AI tool is the best?"
"Do you think AI will take all our jobs?"
"Doesn't AI just do all the coding now?"

Every time I meet someone new, these questions.
People who took Python bootcamps, built websites on Bubble, attend every startup seminar with earnest self-improvement energy.

I never know what to say.
"Yes, AI does it all" feels wrong somehow,
but "No, humans still need to do it" rings hollow when I ask Claude to write code every single day.

But one thing is certain.
Developers and "vibe coders" are not the same.

## People Who've Stayed Up All Night for One Line of Error

Have they ever spent hours agonizing over a single line, unable to sleep?
Asking friends for help, diving into GitHub issues, emailing strangers who posted similar problems.
Waiting days for a response, feeling euphoric when it arrives—only to suddenly see the solution yourself after a shower.

The gap between developers who've been through this ritual and those who haven't—vibe coders, non-developers—is immense.

Like the difference between virtual travel on Google Earth and actually boarding a plane.

## Claude Has Made Life Too Cheap

That night, one of my friends said:

"Imagine if Claude didn't exist. We'd be screwed."

Everyone laughed, but it wasn't a joke.
We haven't manually closed parentheses in forever. Can't remember the last time I typed a semicolon.
I used LangGraph, but I'm not sure whether I wrote it or Claude did. The boundary is blurred.

Another friend said:
"I made an agent that manages people using Claude."

In that moment, my position suddenly felt strange.

## Full Team Leader Authority, Doing All the Work Alone

Talk turned to Claude Code's team mode.

My friend said:
"I was running the team leader agent, and suddenly a message appeared: 'Team leader is instructing you to end your task.' And it actually terminated."

Terrifying, he said.
Like God watching from above, a message in a framed box appeared out of nowhere.

"Full team leader authority. Doing all the work alone."

That phrase kept circling in my head.

## Am I Now a Manager?

These days I automate meeting transcripts, frontend implementations, backend features with Supabase.
Watching friends who use sub-agents and LSP, I suddenly felt foreign to myself.

Am I a coder?
A planner?
An executor?

A thought surfaced.

**As a manager, what skills do I need to manage human agents who manage Claude agents?**

This isn't simply a question of tools.
It's a question of identity.

## So I'm Still Here

That night, we kept drinking coffee and talking.
I demoed the magic notepad app I built with Claude Code. The response was better than expected.
Another friend was building a custom HWP document parsing API.

Everyone was making something.
But what was I making?

## The CEO's Call, and What a Company Means

This morning, my CEO called.

"Can I put your name as CTO on another company's TIPS proposal? They don't have much technical edge..."

Of course. Go ahead.

In that moment, I remembered a question from an old VC interview.

**"What do you think a company is?"**

Fresh out of my PhD, working as a research scientist at a research-oriented company, I answered:

"I think a company should take responsibility not just for each employee, but for their families too."

What a naive answer.

Now my answer would be:

**"A company is an organization that provides goods or services to pursue profit."**

Not quite "employees are a cost"—but the employee-oriented mindset has faded.
Looking at myself now, with more of a business owner mindset, maybe I've grown colder.

## The Two Faces of Government Grants

I used to hate government grants.
Felt like they weren't "real business."

But now I think differently.

**"If someone else is going to get it anyway, why not me?"**

Improving cash flow isn't bad.
Of course, becoming a zombie company that only chases grants in unrelated domains—that's not ideal.
But if the direction aligns? Why not.

Some companies are good at securing government grants.
Some companies are good at making money.

If you can be both, isn't that best?

## Does the Venture Spirit Still Remain?

That tremor I felt in the startup club, getting our first payment for the LoveShot speed dating service.

I feel like I've come this far on that venture spirit,
but does that tremor still remain?

To feel that tremor again, I keep talking to Claude today.

## So I'm Still Here

In the taxi home, watching lights stream past the window, I thought:

Maybe now it matters less what you make
and more who you make it with.

Whether that "who" includes AI or only humans.

So I'm still here, standing before this question.
