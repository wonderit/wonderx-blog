Tuesday evening. English study group.

The topic was "Anti-Valentine's Day," but the conversation quickly drifted elsewhere. One question shifted the entire room's energy.

"Do you believe romance should feel peaceful or exciting?"

I think both are necessary. Exciting first, then peaceful. The problem is the timing in between. That moment when the honeymoon phase ends.

I said.

"I try to speed up that phase. On the second date, I create challenging situations."

Escape rooms. Working out together. Or if things move fast, a trip. When people are under pressure, their real selves emerge. Better to know upfront than to discover "wait, they were like this?" months later.

Then someone replied.

"That's selfish. And a bit rude."

I paused. Selfish? Rude?

They continued.

"Even with someone you've known for a while, there are moments when you don't want to show your bare face. When you don't want to show your worst side."

I nodded, but internally, I disagreed. Not wanting to show your bare face—that's understandable. But if it goes on too long? Eventually you'll have to. So who are we really protecting by delaying that moment?

And more than anything.

I sensed insecurity in those words.

"I prefer being single anyway. I'm focused on my career."

When they said that, their eyes wavered slightly. As if trying to convince someone. Themselves? Or me?

Some people, unable to find love, preemptively declare "I don't need romance anyway." A defense mechanism. Rationalization. That's what it felt like.

Time crawled.

I glanced at my phone and realized there were still 30 minutes left. I wanted to go home.

The conversation continued.

"What scares people more: being alone or being hurt?"

It was one of the printed discussion questions. I already knew the answer.

![The question](/images/blog/voice-af9502-5.webp)

Being hurt is scarier than being alone. So we defend ourselves first. We hide our bare faces, mask our flaws, and say "I prefer being single."

But is that really better?

Or is it just less scary?

I think I'll still suggest escape rooms on second dates. Even if people call me selfish. Even if they say it's rude.

Because I want to know. The real version. What comes after the honeymoon phase.

And if that's selfish, maybe being selfish from the start is more honest.

That's what I thought, Tuesday evening.

On the way home, I bought an Americano from a convenience store. It was cold, and the bitterness slid down my throat.
