Someone said it over coffee.

"Three months. After that, you have to decide."

I took a sip of my Americano. It was hot, and the bitterness lingered on the roof of my mouth.

Three months.

When did we start putting timers on love? When did words like "situationship" and "exclusive" slip into our daily language? We draw boundaries before we define relationships. This is dating, that's a fling, and that over there—well, that's not quite a relationship yet.

They continued.

"We're in a situation, but we're exclusive. We only see each other. But it's not official."

I nodded, though inside, I was confused. Seeing only each other, but not in a relationship? Then what is it? A rehearsal? A trial period?

Why have we become so cautious?

One person said their career came first. Another said their friends all disappeared after getting married. Someone else said they chose marriage because they'd run out of things to do alone.

That last one stayed with me.

"I've done everything I can do alone. I want to try something different now."

There was fatigue in the voice that spoke of marriage like a new project. Social pressure, sure. But beyond the fatigue, maybe there was real loneliness. Even after exhausting all the things you can do alone, the moment comes when you want to share with someone.

The conversation continued.

"You have to talk about money. How much we earn, how much we can spend."

"If we're having kids, parenting values have to align."

"But before all that, shouldn't we know *why* we're even together?"

That last question was the key.

Why are we together?

The 3-month rule, the terms like "exclusive" and "situationship"—maybe they're all just shields against that question. Before confirming real feelings, we measure conditions, calculate timing, and try to make rational decisions.

But relationships aren't rational.

Some days, the sight of them without an umbrella feels sad. Other days, their choice of Americano weighs on you. There are temperature differences you can't explain, attractions you can't define.

So I still ask.

What changes after three months?

When the timer goes off, will we really have the answer?

Or will we just start another three months?

I don't know yet.

So whenever I pass that café, I slow down.
