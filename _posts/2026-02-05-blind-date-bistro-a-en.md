## How We Got Connected

A chance encounter at a conference. A VP at a partner company. A woman my age.

Same age. I hesitated. But I'd already made a promise to myself — meet anyone. The hesitation was brief.

## The Western Restaurant in Munjeong-dong

I stepped inside. She sat against the wall, naturally, as if it were already decided. I took the seat facing the aisle. This is how people always sit at Western restaurants on a date. Nobody arranged it. It just happens.

To my right, two women in their 40s or 50s. They glanced over once. They'd figured out what this was. To my left, two men who looked mid-40s, talking about AI, automation tools, stocks, Samsung Electronics.

I could hear their entire conversation. That told me everything I needed to know about my focus.

She said she felt bad about rescheduling and smoothly picked up the check. Cool. That single gesture — the apology and the action together — said something about who she was.

We were too full for dessert. We decided to find a cafe.

## The Cafe Hunt

I searched and found two promising spots nearby. One had lovely decor, but a dog was running around inside and the energy felt like a house party. Pass. We walked further to the next one. Already closed.

So this is a neighborhood where everything shuts down at 9 PM.

We reached a cafe with a dark interior. 8:46 PM. "We close at nine — is that okay?" We said we'd come back another time.

Secretly, I was hoping to drift toward where I'd parked. She lived nearby, she'd said, so I could offer a ride home later.

We finally found a place. Floor-to-ceiling windows, but the old front door had been left completely intact — as if the renovation had forgotten it, or chosen not to touch it. Inside, about fourteen petit fours sat in a display case. I almost ordered some. Then I remembered I'd already exceeded my calorie budget for the day. Two iced americanos. That was it.

My eyes kept wandering. Four women near the door. Two more at another table. I wasn't paying attention to my date. There's always a reason when you can't focus. The reason is simple — you're not interested.

## Blind Dates and Reading Books

You know within the first few minutes whether there's romantic attraction. While the conversation skated along the surface, I said this:

> "I think blind dates are a lot like reading books.
> When you go on a bad one, just think of it as reading a book."

To find someone who fits, you have to meet many people. So I ask around. I actively request introductions. And I always thank whoever set it up, regardless of how the date went.

## Wrapping Up

I got home and sent a thank-you message. She mentioned she'd be spending the weekend with a friend at home, so I sent a delivery gift card. Nothing behind it. Just wishing her a good time.

The next day, I messaged the VP who'd set us up:

> "Hi! I met the person you introduced me to yesterday!
> We had a great conversation, but I didn't feel a romantic spark.
> Still, thank you so much for connecting us!"

Even when there's no chemistry, you show respect. You thank the matchmaker. And you wait for the next one.

Meeting the right person is like reading many books. Most of them blur in your memory. But every once in a while, you find one with a sentence that stays.

I haven't found that sentence yet.
