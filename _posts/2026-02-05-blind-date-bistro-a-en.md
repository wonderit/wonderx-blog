## How We Got Connected

Random encounter at a conference -> VP at a partner company -> a woman my age.

Same age. I hesitated. But I'd already declared to myself: "I'll meet anyone." So I went.

## The Western Restaurant in Munjeong-dong

She naturally sat on the wall side, and I took the seat facing the wall. That's just how couples — or potential couples — always sit at Western restaurants.

To my right were two women in their 40s-50s. They'd clearly noticed we were on a blind date and snuck a glance. To my left, two men who looked mid-40s, deep in conversation about AI, automation tools, stocks, and Samsung Electronics.

The fact that I could hear their conversation meant one thing: I wasn't focused on mine.

She said she felt bad for rescheduling our date, and smoothly picked up the check. Cool move.

We were too full for dessert, so we decided to find a cafe instead.

## The Cafe Hunt

I searched around and found two promising cafes. One had great decor but also a dog running around and some kind of party vibe going on. Pass. We walked a bit further to the other one — already closed. Turns out everything shuts down by 9 PM around there.

We tried a cafe with a dark interior. Arrived at 8:46 PM. "We close at 9, is that okay?" We said we'd come back another time.

Secretly, I was hoping to wander toward where I'd parked my car. She said she lived nearby anyway, so I could drop her off.

We finally found a place. It had floor-to-ceiling windows but kept the old front door completely intact — like they renovated everything except that one thing. Inside, there were about 14 petit fours left on display. I almost ordered some, but I'd already blown past my calorie limit for the day. We settled on two iced americanos.

My eyes kept drifting to the other tables. Four women near the entrance, two more at another table. I couldn't focus.

## Blind Dates and Reading Books

You can tell within the first few minutes whether there's romantic attraction. While making surface-level conversation, I brought this up:

> "I think blind dates are a lot like reading books.
> When you go on a bad one, just think of it as reading a book."

To find the right person, you need to meet many people. That's why I actively ask people around me to set me up, and I always make sure to thank whoever made the introduction.

## Wrapping Up

When I got home, I sent her a thank-you message. She mentioned she'd be hanging out with a friend at home over the weekend, so I sent a gift card for delivery food.

The next day, I messaged the VP who'd set us up:

> "Hi! I met the person you introduced me to yesterday!
> We had a great conversation, but I didn't feel a romantic spark.
> Still, thank you so much for connecting us!"

Even when there's no chemistry, you still show respect. You always thank the matchmaker. And then you wait for the next one.

Meeting the right person means going through plenty of wrong ones first. That's just how it works.
