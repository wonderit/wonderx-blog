## Why I Went to Mullae-dong

Saturday afternoon. I headed to a "Begin Again" 12:12 mixer party in Mullae-dong.

The venue was called "Hongyeon," tucked away in Mullae's industrial district. The only perk? On weekends, you can park literally anywhere because all the factories are closed.

## My Mental State, Shaken from the Start

I arrived and went looking for the restroom. The public bathroom was ancient — the water didn't even run. I couldn't wash my hands, so I ended up walking all the way back to Mullae Station just to use a proper restroom.

My energy was already draining fast.

When I walked in, the male attendees didn't seem like my crowd, and the women didn't give off any "come talk to me" vibes either.

I knew it right then. **"Today is a bust."**

## The Party Atmosphere

Inside, the walls were covered in red wallpaper with white tables scattered around. Heaters were blasting under the tables, making the air painfully dry. Each table had wine glasses set up. I don't drink, so I went with grape juice.

The space was cramped. You could literally see the MC shuffling back and forth behind the wall.

## How the 12:12 System Works

Three men and three women sit at each table, then rotate every 30 minutes. Pretty standard mixer format.

### First Table: The Subtle Age Gap Wall

There was a woman who looked like Kim Minji. I wanted to chat more, but she was two years younger than me. These days, I feel like there needs to be a four-to-five-year age gap for the conversation to really click, so I passed.

There was also a fitness instructor who lives in Songpa. I mentally bookmarked her. (This decision would come back to haunt me later...)

### The Other Tables: Zero Chemistry

Nurses, office workers... plenty of people, but none who caught my eye in terms of looks or conversation.

As the tables kept rotating, I found myself bonding more and more with the guys instead.

## Birth of the Bromance

We kept getting asked "What's your ideal type?" To keep things interesting, the three of us guys coordinated our answers each round, making sure to give different responses every time.

Through this teamwork, a natural bromance was born.

### The Pharmacist (Same Age)

Hamster-faced. First impression was average, but the more I looked, the more charming he got — a classic "grows on you" type. We clicked right away.

### The Chef

He seemed to know some of the cast from the TV show *Black & White Chef*. He was an MC-type personality himself — funny, outgoing, and great at keeping the mood alive.

## The After-Party Bromance

When the party ended, the three of us decided to grab food together.

Since I don't drink, we tried to find a chicken place but struck out. We ended up at a cozy bar nearby with warm yellow lighting and antique furniture.

We ordered pajeon (Korean pancake) and pasta.

The table next to us had college girls throwing a birthday party. We watched them with envy, half-joking: "Anyone got someone to set us up with?"

We chatted for about an hour, then called it a night.

I drove the chef home, and on the way, we discovered something:

**All three of us had picked the same women.**

- No. 12: The one who looks like Karina/Kim Minji
- No. 9: Another one we all liked
- No. 11: The fitness instructor

## Matching Results

For my final picks, I chose No. 9, No. 11, and No. 12.

No. 9 had something in her eyes — a brightness, a certain clarity. No. 11 was the fitness instructor.

Lately, when people ask me my ideal type, I say "someone soft and warm." When they ask why I prefer younger women, it's because in my experience, they tend to have a sense of wonder about new things and genuine gratitude for small gestures of kindness.

That's why with No. 9, I sensed something slightly different — not that softness, but more of a "I want to fit the man into my framework" kind of energy.

A few days later, the matching results came in via text.

> **You've been matched with No. 9, No. 11, and No. 12!**

For a brief moment, I felt like the most popular guy at the party.

## But Then...

Out of the three, I ended up going on an after-date with No. 11, the fitness instructor...

**And that's where the trouble began.** (To be continued in the next post...)

## Final Thoughts

The Mullae-dong 12:12 mixer party — no romance, but I definitely walked away with a solid bromance.

The pharmacist and the chef? We still keep in touch. Maybe this is the kind of connection that actually lasts.

**So which of the three matches worked out?**

(Spoiler: None of them did.)
