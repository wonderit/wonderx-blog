## Why I Went to Mullae-dong

Saturday afternoon. Mullae-dong was quiet. The factories had shut their doors for the weekend, and the streets smelled like nothing — just cold wind pushing through empty lots.

The venue was called "Hongyeon," somewhere deep in the industrial zone. The only upside to this location? Free parking everywhere, because nothing else was open.

## My Mental State, Shaken from the Start

I found the public restroom. Turned the faucet. Nothing came out. Just a dry rattle from rusted pipes. I ended up walking all the way back to Mullae Station. To wash my hands.

My energy drained before the party even started.

When I walked in, I scanned the room. The men didn't feel like my people. The women didn't feel like anyone I wanted to approach. The temperature in the room was wrong — not the air, but the mood.

I knew it instantly. **"Today is a bust."**

## The Party Atmosphere

Red wallpaper. White tables. Heaters running under the floor, sucking every drop of moisture from the air. Wine glasses were set at every seat, but I don't drink. I poured myself grape juice. Imagine being the grape juice guy at a singles mixer.

The space was cramped. I could hear the MC shuffling behind the partition wall.

## How the 12:12 System Works

Three men, three women per table. Rotate every thirty minutes.

### First Table: The Wall Called Age

There she was — a woman who looked like Kim Minji. I wanted to talk to her. But she was two years younger than me. Lately, I've felt like I need a four-to-five-year gap for conversation to really flow. I don't know why. It just is.

There was also a fitness instructor living in Songpa. I mentally bookmarked her. I had no idea what that bookmark would cost me later.

### The Other Tables: Zero Chemistry

Nurses. Office workers. Plenty of people, but nothing caught — not in their faces, not in their words.

And here's the strange thing. With every rotation, I found myself getting closer to the guys instead.

## Birth of the Bromance

"What's your ideal type?"

The question came around at every table. To keep things from getting stale, the three of us started coordinating. A quick glance to set the order. One guy answers seriously, another riffs off it. We became a unit.

At some point, I realized — we actually clicked.

### The Pharmacist (Same Age)

Hamster face. Unremarkable at first glance. But the longer we talked, the more charm surfaced. The kind of person who grows on you. Our conversation had rhythm — the kind you only get when you're on the same wavelength.

### The Chef

He knew people from the TV show *Black & White Chef*. Natural entertainer, mood-maker, the kind of laugh that opens a room.

## The After-Party Bromance

The party ended. The three of us, without discussion, decided to keep going.

I don't drink, so we tried to find a fried chicken place. Failed. We ended up at a bar nearby instead — warm yellow lighting, antique furniture. We ordered pajeon and pasta. Pasta at a bar. But somehow it worked.

At the next table, college girls were throwing a birthday party. I watched the candle on their cake flicker. Someone muttered, "Anyone know a girl who's single?"

We talked for about an hour. Then called it a night.

I drove the chef home. On the way, we discovered something.

**All three of us had picked the same women.**

- No. 12: The one who looked like Karina/Kim Minji
- No. 9: Another one we all liked
- No. 11: The fitness instructor

We looked at each other and laughed. It was a bitter kind of laugh.

## Matching Results

I submitted my final picks: No. 9, No. 11, No. 12.

No. 9 had something in her eyes — a sharpness, a clarity. No. 11 was the fitness instructor.

When people ask me my ideal type these days, I say "someone soft." When they ask why I prefer younger women, it's because I've noticed something in people with less experience. A sense of wonder at new things. Genuine gratitude for small kindnesses. That softness.

With No. 9, I sensed something different. Not softness — more of a quiet insistence on fitting me into her framework. Subtle, but unmistakable.

A few days later, a text arrived.

> **You've been matched with No. 9, No. 11, and No. 12!**

For a moment, I felt like the most popular guy at the party. Just a moment.

## But Then...

Out of the three, I ended up going on an after-date with No. 11, the fitness instructor.

**And that's where the trouble began.** (To be continued in the next post...)

## Final Thoughts

The Mullae-dong 12:12 mixer party. No romance. But bromance — that, I got.

The pharmacist and the chef? We still text sometimes. Maybe the real connection that day was never across the table. It was beside me the whole time.

Which of the three matches worked out, you ask?

None of them. Not a single one.
