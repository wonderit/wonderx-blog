## Friday the 13th

The sun was setting.
Why did it have to be Friday the 13th?

Someone I met at LST Together reached out after a long time. Asked if I was going to the ski camp. That's how we met for dinner. The sunset on the way there had a hazy feeling. It felt somehow unreal.

## A Sober Evening

When we met, everyone had a vibe of not drinking.
I'm not someone who doesn't drink—I can't drink. So it was actually perfect for me.

Stone-cold sober, everyone ate appetizers like they were meals.
Fried food, yukhoe (beef tartare), grilled meat.
For the second round, we went to a late-night café.
Even had some two-zone cookies.

The night before the holiday, still single, I wondered with a younger friend from the same gathering: where should we go to see what people are up to these days? We found out that a new club had opened in the spot where a hot club used to be 10 years ago.

When I searched it up, I saw the name of a popular house DJ from back when I used to work the lasers. It felt good to see that name again.

## Returning to That Place

LION SUPERCLUB.
I saw the golden lion sign.

10 years ago, I worked there as a part-timer, manning the lights and lasers next to the DJ, syncing with the beat.
Countless songs I heard at dawn.
Past nights spent with overflowing passion.

Returning to that place felt surreal.

If life were a book, I remembered the part that brilliantly decorated Chapter 1.
The thought came back: it's time to move on to Chapter 2.

We ate burgers again and headed home.

Chapter 1 is over.
That's why I still slow down whenever I pass that club.
