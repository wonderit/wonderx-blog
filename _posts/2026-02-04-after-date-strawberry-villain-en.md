## Before We Even Met

I set up a Wednesday dinner with the fitness instructor I'd matched with at the [Mullae-dong 12:12 mixer party](/posts/mullae-1212-party-bromance-en/). She lives around Songpa, so we agreed to meet somewhere near her area.

I rearranged my existing plans for this date.

We'd agreed on 6:30, but she messaged me in the afternoon asking if 7 o'clock would be okay. Sure, no problem.

Then, close to 7, another message. She'd accidentally fallen asleep. She'd get ready quickly and be there soon — about 15 minutes, she said.

I was already standing in front of the restaurant, so I ducked into a nearby cafe to wait.

Seems like nothing, right? But these small things add up, and they shift the vibe.

## Round 1: The Neighborhood Shabu-Shabu Spot

I like small, local gems. Doesn't need to be famous — just good food. So I suggested a shabu-shabu and kalguksu (knife-cut noodle) place nearby.

She seemed to have been expecting something... different. Her expression tightened just slightly.

We ordered two servings with extra meat. I paid.

## Round 2: The Cafe and the Strawberry Tart

We found a trendy-looking cafe nearby. Raw concrete interior, beanbag sofas — that kind of vibe.

I ordered drinks and a strawberry tart. When it came time to pay, she just stood quietly behind me, so I paid for this too.

I'd covered dinner, so I'd expected at least a gesture at the cafe — not necessarily paying, but just a simple "Oh, let me get this one." Something. Anything. There was nothing.

### The Strawberries on the Tart

We sat down and started eating the tart. She picked off the strawberries one by one, eating only those.

It's a small thing. But in that moment, something clicked. I just knew.

The conversation felt like two different temperatures colliding. I wasn't particularly interested in her stories either. We kept exchanging surface-level talk that never went deeper, so naturally, it wasn't fun.

Awkward silences crept in. She seemed uncomfortable, but I didn't bother filling them.

## Comparisons Come Naturally

A few days earlier, I'd met [someone through a different blind date](/posts/blind-date-bistro-a-en/). There was no romantic spark, but she'd said, "I feel bad for rescheduling on you," and naturally picked up the dinner check.

Regardless of whether there's attraction, manners become the standard by which you judge a person.

## A Short Goodbye

We both must have felt that the evening wasn't going anywhere. We didn't linger. Just wrapped things up.

"Get home safe."

That was it.

## Looking Back

Dating is a process of meeting all kinds of people. Even a bad match teaches you something.

Here's what I took away from this one:

The right person for me is someone who can genuinely enjoy a humble neighborhood restaurant together. Someone who prefers a cozy, low-key spot over a fancy restaurant. Because that's just who I am.
