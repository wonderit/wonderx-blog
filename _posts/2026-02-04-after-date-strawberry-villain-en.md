## Before We Even Met

It was a Wednesday evening. I had an after-date lined up with the fitness instructor I'd matched with at the [Mullae-dong 12:12 mixer party](/posts/mullae-1212-party-bromance-en/). She lived near Songpa, so we agreed to meet somewhere in her neighborhood.

I'd rearranged my existing plans for this. That's how much I was looking forward to it.

We'd agreed on 6:30. In the afternoon, she texted — could she push it to 7? Sure, no problem.

Close to 7, another message. She'd fallen asleep. She'd hurry and get ready. Fifteen minutes, she said.

I was already standing in front of the restaurant. I walked into a nearby cafe, sat down, and took a sip of americano. The sun was setting through the window.

It seems like nothing. But these small things accumulate, and with each one, the temperature of expectation drops by a degree. She didn't know that.

## Round 1: The Neighborhood Shabu-Shabu Spot

I like small, unassuming places. No need to be famous — just good food. So I suggested a shabu-shabu and noodle spot nearby.

Her expression tightened. Half a second. I caught it. She'd been expecting something different.

We ordered two servings with extra meat. I paid.

## Round 2: The Cafe and the Strawberry Tart

We found a trendy-looking cafe nearby. Raw concrete walls. Beanbag sofas. Indirect lighting bouncing off exposed surfaces.

I ordered drinks and a strawberry tart. At the register, she stood quietly behind me.

I paid for this too.

I'd covered dinner. I figured she'd at least offer at the cafe — not necessarily pay, but just the gesture. "Oh, let me get this one." That's all it would have taken. There was nothing.

### The Strawberries on the Tart

We sat down. She started eating the tart. Or rather — she started eating the strawberries. One by one, her fork lifted the red berries from the top while the cream and crust sat untouched below.

A small thing. But in that moment, something became clear. I can't explain it. I just knew.

The conversation ran at two different temperatures. I wasn't drawn to her stories either. We kept exchanging words that never broke the surface. It wasn't fun.

Silences crept in. She seemed uncomfortable. I didn't try to fill them. There was no reason to.

## Comparisons Come Naturally

I thought about the woman I'd met [on a different blind date](/posts/blind-date-bistro-a-en/) a few days earlier. No romantic spark between us, but she'd said, "I feel bad for rescheduling," and naturally picked up the dinner check.

Whether there's attraction or not, manners are how a person faces the world. It's not about the other person. It's about the standard you hold for yourself.

## A Short Goodbye

We both felt it — the evening wasn't going anywhere. We didn't stay long.

"Get home safe."

That was the last thing said. My footsteps felt light walking away.

## Looking Back

Dating is a process of meeting many people. Even the wrong ones leave something behind.

What this one left me with is simple.

I want someone who can enjoy a humble neighborhood restaurant with me. Someone who'd rather eat comfortably at a small place tucked in an alley than perform at a fancy dinner. That's who I am.

And someone who picks only the strawberries off the tart — I probably can't sit across from them for very long.
