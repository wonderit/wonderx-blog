The sunset was hazy that evening.
Friday the 13th. For some reason, the sky wasn't clear.

I met up with people I had connected with at LST Together.
Faces I hadn't seen in years, brought together again by talk of a ski camp.
I couldn't remember how long it had been since we last spoke, but that night, it felt natural.

On the way there, the sun was sinking through the haze.
Friday, the 13th—something about the combination felt like it would be a special night.

When we met, no one was drinking.
I can't handle alcohol either, so it actually worked out well.

Sober, we ate snacks like they were a full meal.
Beef tartare, fried foods, grilled meat.
I thought it might be awkward without alcohol, but I was wrong.
If anything, the memories stayed sharper.

For the second round, we went to a café.
Cheesecake, burger buns, cream drinks.
The night seemed to pass slowly.

But then, the night before a long weekend, single and with the gathering winding down—what next?
My friend and I made eye contact.

"Wanna see what people are up to these days?"

A quick search revealed a new club in the spot where a popular one used to be 10 years ago.

**LION SUPERCLUB.**

Seeing the name was a pleasant surprise.
Back when I used to shoot lasers—working part-time next to the DJ, syncing lights and lasers to the beat—this DJ was popular then.
It was surreal to see they were still active.

Returning to that place after 10 years.
It hit differently.

The songs I heard countless times at dawn.
The nights I spent with so much energy.

I didn't know back then.
That those moments were the grand finale of Chapter 1 of my life.

We left the club and ate burgers again.
2 a.m., stone-cold sober, and somehow the burger tasted amazing.

Chapter 1 is ending.
It feels like it's time to move on to Chapter 2.

But sometimes, it's not so bad to flip back through the pages of Chapter 1.
That Friday the 13th was one of those nights.
