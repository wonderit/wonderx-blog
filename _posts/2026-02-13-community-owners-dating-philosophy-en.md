Thursday, 7 PM, a café in Gangnam.

Greenery drapes along the windows, and at the next table, a brown poodle and a white Bichon wag their tails at each other. We glance at the dogs, laugh, and then fall back into conversation.

Today's topic: dating.

This gathering started at an LST pairing session. The conversation flowed so well that it led to a group chat called "Community Owners." We all share an interest in interpersonal communication and psychology, and we love talking about these things. Every Thursday evening, we meet like this to dissect each other's lives.

Today, one friend brought up a recent breakup.

"I met her through a blind date in November, and at first, we really clicked. We played games together, like TFT. But after about three weeks… I couldn't see a future."

TFT. Playing a game like that together, one that women don't typically play, seemed like a sign of compatibility. But as time passed, he began to notice something else.

"She kept asking me things like, 'Am I going to be a burden to you? Is that okay?' and 'How much do you love me?' I wanted her to look at things more positively, to see my potential…"

## People Who Seek Growth, and Those Who Don't

As I listened, similar experiences flickered through my mind.

People who seek growth.
People who don't.

When these two types meet, there's a wall. It's invisible at first, but over time, the temperature difference becomes clearer.

Another friend spoke up.

"I'm the same way. I'm always learning, developing myself, thinking, 'Shouldn't we be doing this?' But the people I dated had no ambition. After work, they didn't study, they were just… relaxed. And I couldn't stand it."

He said he repeated this pattern three times.

Each time, the pattern was similar. Things were good early on, but as time passed, he couldn't handle his partner's passivity. So he tried to change them. He made portfolios for them, helped them prep for interviews, and turned someone with only 2 million won into someone with 200 million.

"But she wasn't even grateful."

There was a hint of defeat in his voice.

"That's when I realized. I'm the problem. I'm attracted to these people. Subconsciously, I'm drawn to people who seem easygoing, but I can't tolerate it in the end."

## Why Are We Drawn to Them?

We lingered on that question for a while.

Why do we keep getting drawn to people we can't change?

One friend cautiously floated a hypothesis.

"I like adventurous people. But women, relatively speaking, have to seek stability more than men do. Even so, I don't try to hide the risky aspects of myself. I amplify them. I want to see if she'll still choose me."

She said she deliberately shows her risks.

"I'll say things like, 'My dream is to open a club. I hate people with no experience, they're boring.' I throw stuff like that out there. Some guys hear that and think, 'This woman is dangerous,' and they leave. But those people weren't right for me anyway. I give higher value to the ones who cross that threshold."

And that's where the illusion happened.

Just because someone crossed the threshold, she overestimated them.

"But looking back, those people were… careless. Three in a row, all got burned somewhere during the relationship. I've never had anything like that happen to me."

## Between Impulsiveness and Courage

Carelessness. Impulsiveness. Courage.

Where's the line between these?

We talked about this boundary for a long time. Someone who seems impulsive and reckless can also appear courageous and adventurous. And the line between them is incredibly blurry.

"I think I get it now. What I like is 'fun' and 'courage,' but it might actually stem from 'impulsiveness.' And you can't tell the difference at first."

So she repeated the pattern three times, and now she's more cautious.

## Date Someone Who Seeks Growth

The elders around us always say:

"Date someone who wants to grow."

At first, that sounded old-fashioned. But as time goes by, the weight of those words becomes heavier.

"I always said I wanted someone who could be my partner as we move through the world, someone who creates synergy instead of just one person's worth of effort. But the people I dated always needed me to take care of them."

He said he was exhausted.

Reading their emotions, teaching them, helping them grow. He wanted to build that foundation together and then share it, but things always stopped before that stage.

"But the elders told me: people with the same mindset as you want a power couple, not a relationship. They don't want to date you."

That felt bitter.

## If My Ideal Type Is Someone Like Me

We continued the conversation.

People ultimately end up with someone similar to themselves. The average of the ten people around you is who you are.

So, if you want to meet someone like you, you have to become that person first.

"I never want to grow up. I want to stay curious, to live life in a fun way. So I like women who are carefree…"

He laughed.

"But to be carefree, you need to have lived without hardship, to have been loved so much that you don't even know what love is. That kind of person… they're really hard to find."

## In Your 30s, Different Timelines for Women and Men

One friend quietly said:

"As women enter their 30s, their genes start making them want to have children. Men, too, instinctively want kids, even if they don't realize it. So smart women start looking for 'someone I want to leave my genes with in this world.'"

Some people go from not thinking about marriage to suddenly wanting three kids. Wanting children makes you want to meet a good person, and wanting to meet someone like you makes you work on becoming a better person yourself.

"Maybe the drive to live well comes from wanting to meet a good person. It might sound strange to say you work hard because of a woman, but why shouldn't that be okay?"

We were silent for a while.

And then someone laughed and said:

"That's why I still slow down when I pass by that café."

The dogs were now asleep in their owners' arms, and we were still talking.

There were no answers.

But we were a little clearer than before.
