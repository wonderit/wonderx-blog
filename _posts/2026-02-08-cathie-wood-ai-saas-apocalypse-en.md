## Saturday Evening, YouTube Was On

I was lying on the couch with YouTube running. Saturday evening. No agenda, just scrolling through recommendations, and then Cathie Wood's face appeared on the screen.

ARK Invest CEO. A 30-minute video. The title: "Cathie Wood On Bitcoin Volatility And SaaSpocalypse Fears."

I hit play and closed my eyes. Around the ten-minute mark, I sat up. There's something about her voice — when she talks, the scattered thoughts in my head start arranging themselves into rows.

## Is AI a Bubble?

"Isn't AI just the dot-com bubble all over again?"

I've heard this question too many times. At holiday dinners, after-work drinks, in the back of a taxi. People's eyes always hold the same two things at once — anxiety and hope.

Cathie Wood says it plainly. **No.**

I feel the same way. This isn't a bubble. It's foundation work. I think about when smartphones arrived. People called that a bubble too. Same with cloud computing. And then, quietly, while no one was paying attention, the world changed.

The real beneficiaries turn out to be surprisingly simple.

- **Hyperscalers** — Google, Microsoft, AWS. Data centers, cloud infrastructure.
- **Semiconductors** — NVIDIA, AMD. GPUs, AI chips.

The companies laying pipe. Not the flashy apps, but the cement underneath everything.

## SaaS Is Dead

There was one word Cathie Wood kept circling back to. **SaaSpocalypse.** The death of SaaS.

The moment I heard it, I pictured my browser's bookmark bar. Framer, FlutterFlow, Webflow, Zapier. Tabs I used to open every single day.

I don't open them anymore.

**Claude Code builds it directly.** Faster, more precise, and exactly the way I want it.

SaaS tools sold the dream of "No-Code." You don't need to know how to code, they promised. But Claude Code gives you **actual code.** Code I can read. Code I can change. Not "you don't need to know" — but "you know, and you move fast."

AI solved the problem SaaS was trying to solve, and it solved it at the root. Sometimes change arrives like that. The thing being replaced hasn't even noticed yet.

## Bitcoin vs Gold

Cathie Wood prefers Bitcoin over gold.

- Gold: Inflation hedge. Traditional. Safe.
- Bitcoin: Digital gold. Scarce. Global.

The market dipped.

Most people get anxious. I'm a little different. The person who buys when it falls and the person who sells when it falls — the gap between them reveals itself a few years later.

**BTC, XRP. When it drops, I buy. Long-term hold.** There is no strategy beyond that. The more complicated you make the game, the more likely you are to lose. That's what I believe.

## 2026 Macro Outlook

Cathie Wood's forecast, simplified:

- **Interest rates** — Deflationary pressure. Rate cuts possible.
- **AI infrastructure** — Data center and GPU demand exploding.
- **Labor market** — AI-driven productivity revolution. The way we work is changing.

She said she's concentrating on hyperscalers and semiconductors.

I'm pointed in the same direction. The scale is different, though. I'm an individual investor. The kind who builds strategy on a couch while watching YouTube. Still, I think the direction is right.

## Jensen Huang's One-Liner

Somewhere in the middle of the Cathie Wood video, a Jensen Huang interview surfaced in my memory.

> "Coding was the first thing to get automated as AI advanced. Things have changed now. **Intuition — vibes — that's what matters.**"

Data tells you about the past. Intuition sees the future.

I sat with that thought for a while. What I do with Claude Code follows the same structure: **my intuition sets the direction, and AI handles the execution.** An era where gut feeling matters more than coding skill. Strangely, that idea calmed me.

It means the thing that survives isn't technical ability. It's sense.

## My Investment Strategy

I'll write this honestly. No polish.

### Buy Bitcoin on Dips

When it drops, I buy. BTC, XRP. Long-term. This isn't speculation — it's the conclusion I reached after living through several downturns.

### Focus on AI Infrastructure

SaaS tools will get replaced. But **GPUs, data centers, and cloud — those are irreplaceable.**
NVIDIA, Google, AWS. Not the glamorous services, but the land those services run on.

### NeoCloud (iLEN)

Domestically, I've been watching **NeoCloud**. AI infrastructure, data centers. I have a feeling it'll grow over the long term.

Of course I'm not certain. I don't trust anyone who claims certainty about investments. Direction instead of conviction — that's how I've been living.

## Wrapping Up

I didn't expect a single Cathie Wood video to become this essay. I just turned on YouTube from the couch, and somehow every loose thought I'd been carrying found its way into a line.

- **AI infrastructure** — invest in the companies building the rails
- **Bitcoin** — buy on dips
- **SaaS** — it's over. We build it ourselves now

---

I'm not mourning SaaS. I can build something better with my own hands now. And maybe that's the quiet privilege of living in this particular moment.
