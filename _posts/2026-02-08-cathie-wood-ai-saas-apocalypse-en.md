## Saturday Evening, YouTube Was On

A video from ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood popped up. 30 minutes long. Title: "Cathie Wood On Bitcoin Volatility And SaaSpocalypse Fears."

I hit play, lay down on the couch, and by the 10-minute mark I was sitting up straight.

## Is AI a Bubble?

A lot of people keep asking. "Isn't AI just the dot-com bubble all over again?"

Cathie Wood says it clearly. **No.**

I agree. Honestly, this isn't a bubble — it's infrastructure replacement. When smartphones came out, people called it a bubble. Same thing when cloud computing arrived. And then the world changed.

The real beneficiaries are simple.

- **Hyperscalers** — Google, Microsoft, AWS. Data centers, cloud infrastructure.
- **Semiconductors** — NVIDIA, AMD. GPUs, AI chips.

The companies laying down the infrastructure. That's the answer.

## SaaS Is Dead

One of the biggest points Cathie Wood hammered home was **SaaSpocalypse** — the death of SaaS.

I feel it too. I don't use Framer anymore. FlutterFlow? Nope. Webflow, Zapier? All gone.

**Claude Code builds it directly.** Faster, more accurate, and exactly the way I want it.

SaaS tools sold the dream of "No-Code." But Claude Code gives you **actual code.** Code that I understand. Code that I can modify however I want.

That's the game changer. AI solved the problem that SaaS was trying to solve — and it solved it better.

## Bitcoin vs Gold

Cathie Wood prefers Bitcoin over gold.

- Gold: Inflation hedge. Traditional. Safe.
- Bitcoin: Digital gold. Scarce. Global.

A dip? That's a buying opportunity.

I'm on the same page. **BTC, XRP. When it drops, I buy. Long-term hold.** That's it.

## 2026 Macro Outlook

Cathie Wood's forecast:

- **Interest rates** — Deflationary pressure. Rate cuts possible.
- **AI infrastructure** — Data center and GPU demand exploding.
- **Labor market** — AI-driven productivity revolution. The way we work is changing.

She said she's concentrating investments on hyperscalers and semiconductors.
I'm aligned on direction. I'm just an individual investor, so the scale is a bit different.

## Jensen Huang's One-Liner

While watching the Cathie Wood video, a Jensen Huang interview came to mind.

> "Coding was the first thing to get automated as AI advanced. Things have changed now. **Intuition — vibes — that's what matters.**"

Data tells you about the past. Intuition sees the future.

I completely agree with this. When I give instructions to Claude Code, it's ultimately **my intuition setting the direction, and AI doing the execution.** We've entered an era where gut feeling matters more than coding skill.

## My Investment Strategy

Let me lay it out honestly.

### Buy Bitcoin on Dips

When it drops, I buy. BTC, XRP. Long-term. This isn't guesswork — it's strategy.

### Focus on AI Infrastructure

SaaS tools will get replaced. But **GPUs, data centers, and cloud — those are irreplaceable.**
NVIDIA, Google, AWS. These are the real winners.

### NeoCloud (iLEN)

Domestically, I'm keeping an eye on **NeoCloud**. AI infrastructure, data centers. I think it'll grow long-term. Of course I'm not certain. Anyone who says they're "certain" about investing is lying.

## Wrapping Up

Didn't expect a single Cathie Wood video to turn into this entire post.

The takeaway is simple.
- **AI infrastructure** — invest in companies building the rails
- **Bitcoin** — buy on dips
- **SaaS** — it's over. We build it ourselves now

I'm not sad that SaaS is dying. Because now I can build something better with my own hands.
