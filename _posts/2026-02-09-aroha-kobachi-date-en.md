## Aroha Matchmaking: Less Photo-Reality Gap

Unlike major matchmaking agencies (Duo, Gayeon), Aroha **doesn't over-edit photos**. There's minimal gap between photos and reality, so you rarely get that awkward "Wait, you look different from your photo?" moment. Instead, female members tend to have **strong backgrounds or capabilities** rather than just looks.

It gives the impression of being a place where daughters/sons of wealthy families often show up. Many seem to join not by their own choice, but encouraged by their parents.

## Two Heat Packs in My Pocket

I had two boxes of heat packs left at home, so I stuffed two in my pocket to use them up. A pragmatist's approach. 6 PM, a Japanese restaurant 'Kobachi' near Jamsil Station.

When I arrived, I spotted the woman near the restroom. **She looked exactly like her photo, so I recognized her immediately**. But I pretended not to notice and went in. A cautious message came shortly after, and we sat together.

## Slurping Egg Custard, and Fist-Gripping Chopsticks

I was comfortable enough to slurp my egg custard. But she was gripping her chopsticks **like a fist**, clearly very nervous. She kept covering her mouth while eating, and I could feel her discomfort.

'Ah, not much dating experience.'

## Kwak Beom vs Bibi, and Eye Spark

"What's your ideal type?"

She said she likes the **fun style like Kwak Beom**. I answered I like the **darkened IU (Bibi)** style. I also mentioned I prefer the humor code of Tak Jae-hoon and Lee Yong-jin.

Physical preference? She mentioned **Park Hyung-sik**. I said I like people with lively eyes, what I call **"eye spark"**.

But she described her own eyes as "dull and cloudy" and couldn't maintain eye contact well. Eyes that looked somewhat anxious with little dating experience. **'This won't be easy'** — that intuition hit me.

## 0 or 1, Binary Life

"Why don't you get stressed?"

When I work, I'm energetic and have a clear **0-or-1 binary personality**. She seemed to think I don't get stressed.

Actually, I get stressed by people who just whine about quitting their job but never act. I prefer **action-oriented people (demanding)**.

## Life's Chapter 2, The Marriage Quest

"Why do you want to get married?"

**Solo life holds no more mysteries for me**. Friends are clearing quests in **Chapter 2 (marriage/parenting)** of life, while I'm still stuck in Chapter 1.

In RPG terms, I've cleared all side quests in Chapter 1 and leveled up sufficiently. Now I want to move to the next chapter, but I need a partner to start the **main quest (marriage)**.

## Pancake House, and Gloomy Lotte Tower

Second round at a pancake house. We had to order even though we were full. I found myself distracted by the **real estate loan and wedding preparation talk** from the next table.

Rainy Lotte Tower area. Gloomy weather, couples in coats walking with **black umbrellas**. I felt a strange sense of disconnection.

'Will I ever be like that?'

## When Will Chapter 2 Begin?

Matchmaking dates have become a **routine** now. The meeting itself wasn't bad, but it was more about **observation** than excitement.

Waiting for Chapter 2, I turn another page at the end of Chapter 1 today.
