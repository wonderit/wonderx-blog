I spotted a book at the hair salon. Something like "How to Eat Gracefully at Forty" — an essay collection. Gracefully. Eating. I figured it was about mindset or life philosophy. But at dinner that evening, the whole idea of "grace" took an unexpected turn.

## What Mom Always Said

"You absolutely must be good with chopsticks."

That was my mom's rule. Chopstick skills equal manners. Full stop. At first, it sounded like an exaggeration. But in reality, people notice. How you hold your chopsticks. How well you handle them.

We were eating chicken, and naturally the conversation drifted to chopstick technique. You shouldn't cross them in an X — that's the basic rule. Then it escalates: level 1, level 2, level 3... like some kind of certification test with increasing difficulty.

## Can You Do It Left-Handed?

Someone mentioned that pickled radish cubes are doable with the left hand. We actually tested it. Picking up shredded radish with left-hand chopsticks. The grip was shaky, but somehow I pulled it off. The verdict: "Pass."

Do you really need to be able to use chopsticks with your left hand? Maybe not. But isn't this exactly what "eating gracefully" is about? The ability to handle even uncomfortable situations with composure.

## Where Texture Meets Taste

Bony foods, foods with skin, soft and squishy textures. Everyone has something they can't handle. Chicken feet, chicken wings, skin... "It's full of collagen, great for your skin," they say. But if the texture doesn't work for you, it just doesn't.

Being good with chopsticks ultimately means being able to handle any kind of food. Big, small, slippery, firm. Whatever shows up on your plate, you can pick it up naturally and eat it without a fuss.

## What Is Elegance, Really?

Chopstick skills as a measure of character — it sounded like a stretch at first. But watching people at the dinner table, it started to make sense. The way you approach food. The consideration you show the people you're eating with. Keeping your cool even when things get awkward.

Eating gracefully isn't a skill. It's a mindset. The skill — the chopstick technique — is just how that mindset shows up in the real world.

That essay I saw at the salon? I never actually got to read it. But the title alone gave me plenty to think about. Whether you're twenty or forty, eating gracefully means something far beyond just putting food in your mouth.
