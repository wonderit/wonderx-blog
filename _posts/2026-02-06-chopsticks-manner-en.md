I was sitting in the salon chair. Snippets of hair fell silently between the sound of scissors. There was a book on the side table. Something like "How to Eat Gracefully at Forty." Gracefully. Eating. I stared at those two words for a long time.

That evening, the idea of "grace" rolled in a direction I never expected.

## The Sentence My Mother Left Me

"You absolutely must be good with chopsticks."

My mother said this at the dinner table when I was small. The way you hold chopsticks is the way people read your character, she said. I thought she was exaggerating. What could two wooden sticks possibly reveal about a person?

But people notice. More precisely than you'd think.

We were pulling apart chicken, and the conversation drifted to chopstick technique. Don't cross them in an X — that's the first rule. Then it escalates: level one, level two, level three. Like a promotion exam held right there on the dinner table.

## The Left-Hand Test

Someone claimed pickled radish cubes are manageable with the left hand. So we tried it for real. Picking up shredded radish with left-hand chopsticks.

My fingertips trembled, just slightly. The grip wouldn't hold. But somehow, one strand made it across.

"Pass."

When that single word dropped, I felt an absurd surge of pride.

Is left-handed chopstick skill something anyone actually needs? Probably not. But maybe that's exactly what "eating gracefully" means — keeping your composure steady even when your hands aren't.

## The Line Called Texture

Bony foods, foods with skin, things that squish and slide. Everyone has a line they can't cross. Chicken feet, chicken wings, skin. "It's full of collagen, great for your complexion," they say. But when your tongue refuses, it refuses.

Being good with chopsticks means not flinching, no matter what lands on the plate. Big or small, slippery or firm. Lifting it up without a second thought.

That's less a skill than an attitude.

## The Weight of the Word "Elegance"

Chopstick skill as a measure of character. It sounded like a stretch at first.

But watching people across the table, I began to understand. The motion of lifting food, the way someone matches the pace of the person eating beside them, the composure held in front of a dish they'd rather not touch.

Eating gracefully was never about technique. It was about something quieter — a mindset carried all the way to the tips of two wooden sticks.

That essay at the salon? I never turned a single page. But the title was enough. It circled through my head all evening. Whether you're twenty or forty, the way a person eats carries their warmth.
