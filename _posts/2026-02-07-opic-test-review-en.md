## Why I Suddenly Took the OPIc

Saturday, 3:40 PM. Yeoksam, Seoul.

I'd been doing pair sessions and study groups in English communities for a while.
Then one day, the question hit me.

*"Am I actually getting better at this?"*

If you don't measure it, you'll never know.
So I booked the test.

## What the Test Center Looked Like

Yeoksam test center.
Somewhere between a cram school and a study cafe vibe.

White desks, cubicles crammed right next to each other.
CCTV cameras overhead.

Put on the headset, did the mic check.
The OPIc interface appeared on the monitor.

It was quieter than I expected.
All I could hear was my own voice.

## What Questions Came Up

I recorded for about 33 minutes total.
The questions roughly followed this flow:

1. **Self-introduction** — job, where I live, hobbies
2. **Hobbies (hiking)** — where I go, what I wear, what I eat
3. **Transportation** — how I get around, comparing now vs. when I was younger
4. **Banking/Investing** — types of accounts, investment experience, wins and losses
5. **Role-play** — asking a friend for a ride, suggesting alternatives when a car breaks down
6. **Changes in the auto industry** — past vs. present, electric vehicle experience

The questions were more specific than I expected.
They went as deep as "How do you prepare for a hike?"

The finance questions were right in my wheelhouse, so the words just flowed.
I talked about ISA accounts, IRP, Tesla, even the Luna coin crash.

## AI's Analysis of My Answers

Obviously, you can't record during the actual test.
So after I got home, I re-recorded my answers to the same questions from memory.
Then I ran them through Gemini STT for transcription and had AI grade them against OPIc scoring criteria.

### Predicted Level: AL (Advanced Low)

**Overall Assessment:**
- Fluency — Very fluent and consistent speech delivery
- Vocabulary — Excellent domain-specific vocabulary across finance, IT, and automotive topics
- Discourse Structure — Complex ideas presented in logical, well-organized sequences
- Task Completion — Thorough responses to all questions; role-play felt natural
- Grammar — Frequent errors with articles, prepositions, tenses, and subject-verb agreement

### AI's Top 3 Areas for Improvement

**1. Grammar Accuracy Training**
Too many errors with articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), and tenses.
When constructing long sentences, practice locking in the core structure first, then adding details on top.

**2. Learning Natural English Expressions**
Some expressions came out as direct Korean-to-English translations:
- "bright eye" should be "foresight"
- "out of function" should be "out of order"
- "call in" should be "go all in"

Recommendation: shadow native-speaker podcasts and TV shows.

**3. Build a Habit of Recording and Self-Evaluating**
Record my answers and listen back.
Identify which errors keep repeating.
Consciously correct them next time.

## My Takeaway

Of course, the real test and the home re-recording are different conditions.
The test center nerves, the time pressure, the shock of seeing questions for the first time.
Still, it was more than enough to map out my strengths and weaknesses in English.

I used to listen to the All Ears English podcast a lot, and they once said something that stuck with me.

> English is connection, not perfection.

Taking the OPIc made me feel the truth of that statement.
Willingness to communicate and confidence mattered more than perfect grammar.
And honestly, the OPIc scoring rubric reflects the same philosophy.

Here's a fun detail about the difficulty selection.
Mid-test, you get to choose the difficulty level of your questions. I deliberately picked the harder ones.
Easy questions led to short answers. Hard questions gave me more to think about, which actually got me talking more.
If you want to draw words out of yourself, harder questions beat easy ones every time.

My fluency and vocabulary are in decent shape,
but I'm losing points on grammatical details.
Articles, tenses, prepositions — the basics. Words come out easily enough, but accuracy is lacking.

Looking back, I think I've been doing mostly networking-style English.
English communities, pair sessions, free talking. All output, no input.
Now I realize I need to fill up the input side too.
Vocabulary, grammar, reading — the fundamentals.

And as for my next goal — rather than just leveling up my English score,
maybe it'd be fun to try learning an entirely new language.
Japanese? German? Not sure yet.
