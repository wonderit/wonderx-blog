## Why I Suddenly Took the OPIc

Saturday, 3:40 PM. Yeoksam, Seoul.

The light was draining from the sky. I stood in front of the testing center building and thought. For months, I'd been doing pair sessions and study groups in English communities. Chatting in English with strangers had become easy. But a question crept in, quiet and persistent.

*"Am I actually getting better at this?"*

Feeling isn't knowing. You have to measure it.

So I booked the test.

## The Temperature of the Test Room

Yeoksam test center. Somewhere between a cram school and a study cafe.

White desks, cubicles pressed together. CCTV cameras watching silently from above.

I put on the headset. Checked the mic. The OPIc interface blinked onto the screen.

It was quieter than I expected. A faint murmur from the next booth, barely there. Most of the time, the only voice I heard was my own.

There's something strangely lonely about talking to yourself.

## What Questions Came Up

I recorded for about 33 minutes total. The questions roughly followed this flow:

1. **Self-introduction** — job, where I live, hobbies
2. **Hobbies (hiking)** — where I go, what I wear, what I eat
3. **Transportation** — how I get around, comparing now vs. when I was younger
4. **Banking/Investing** — types of accounts, investment experience, wins and losses
5. **Role-play** — asking a friend for a ride, suggesting alternatives when a car breaks down
6. **Changes in the auto industry** — past vs. present, electric vehicle experience

The questions were more specific than I expected. They went as deep as "How do you prepare for a hike?" — as if a close friend were genuinely curious.

The finance questions were right in my wheelhouse. ISA accounts, IRP, Tesla, even the Luna coin crash came pouring out. I surprised myself. When you care about the topic, the language barrier lowers itself.

## Letting AI Grade Me

Obviously, you can't record during the actual test. So I went home and re-recorded my answers to the same questions from memory. A reconstruction built on recall. Then I ran them through Gemini STT for transcription and had AI grade them against OPIc scoring criteria.

Reading my own words transcribed into text brought on an odd wave of embarrassment.

### Predicted Level: AL (Advanced Low)

**Overall Assessment:**
- Fluency — Very fluent and consistent speech delivery
- Vocabulary — Excellent domain-specific vocabulary across finance, IT, and automotive topics
- Discourse Structure — Complex ideas presented in logical, well-organized sequences
- Task Completion — Thorough responses to all questions; role-play felt natural
- Grammar — Frequent errors with articles, prepositions, tenses, and subject-verb agreement

### AI's Top 3 Areas for Improvement

**1. Grammar Accuracy Training**
Too many errors with articles (a/an/the), prepositions (in/on/at), and tenses. When constructing long sentences, practice locking in the core structure first, then layering details on top.

**2. Learning Natural English Expressions**
Some expressions came out as direct Korean-to-English translations:
- "bright eye" should be "foresight"
- "out of function" should be "out of order"
- "call in" should be "go all in"

Recommendation: shadow native-speaker podcasts and TV shows.

**3. Build a Habit of Recording and Self-Evaluating**
Record my answers and listen back. Identify which errors keep repeating. Consciously correct them next time.

## What Stayed With Me

Of course, the real test and the home re-recording lived under different conditions. The test center nerves, the time pressure, the jolt of seeing a question for the first time. Still, it was enough to sketch the outline of my English — where the lines were strong and where they blurred.

I used to listen to the All Ears English podcast a lot. They once said something that lodged itself in my memory.

> English is connection, not perfection.

Taking the OPIc brought that sentence back. The willingness to communicate, the confidence to keep talking even when the grammar buckled — those mattered more than getting every article right. The OPIc scoring rubric itself seemed to agree.

Here's the part that surprised me: the difficulty selection. Mid-test, you get to choose how hard your questions will be. I deliberately picked the harder ones. Easy questions made my answers shrink. Hard questions gave me more to chew on, and the words came pouring out.

It's not the easy questions that draw me out. It's the hard ones. People are the same way, I think. I say more to someone who asks me something difficult than to someone who keeps things comfortable.

Fluency and vocabulary held up fine. Grammar is where the score bled. Articles, tenses, prepositions — the small, invisible scaffolding. The words flowed, but accuracy didn't follow. All those moments I'd let mistakes slide because the meaning got through — they'd piled up quietly.

Looking back, I'd been doing networking-style English all along. Communities, pair sessions, free talking. All output, no input. Now I realize I need to fill the other side. Vocabulary, grammar, reading. Boring, but necessary.

And the next goal? Maybe not raising an English score at all. Maybe picking up an entirely new language. Japanese? German? I don't know yet.

Not knowing feels exciting.
