## Agency A: Between Reality and Photos

Unlike major matchmaking agencies (D, G), I heard that Agency A **doesn't heavily edit photos**.

It was true.

There was no awkward "Wait, you look different from your photo?" moment. Instead, female members tend to have **strong backgrounds or capabilities** rather than just looks.

A place where daughters and sons of wealthy families often show up. Many join not by their own choice, but encouraged by their parents.

## Two Heat Packs in My Pocket

I had two boxes of heat packs left at home.

I stuffed two in my pocket to use them up this winter. A pragmatist's approach.

6 PM, a Japanese restaurant near Jamsil Station.

I parked and arrived. Near the restroom elevator, I spotted someone getting off. **The face from the photo**. I saw her heading to the restroom but pretended not to notice and went in.

A cautious message came shortly after.

"Are you here?"

I went in, and it was her. Seems like everyone feels awkward sitting alone at the meeting place first.

## Slurping Egg Custard, and Fist-Gripping Chopsticks

Three minutes into our conversation, the ideal type topic came up.

She said she likes the **fun style like 'Kwak Beom'**. I said I like **'darkened IU'**, and she immediately caught on: "Bibi?"

I told her I love watching variety shows with Tak Jae-hoon and Lee Yong-jin.

I prefer relationships like best friends. When you're together, "It's already 10 PM" is good, not "It's still only 10 PM."

Physical preference? She mentioned **'Park Hyung-sik'**.

I said I like people with lively eyes, what I call **'eye spark'**.

But she described her own eyes as "dull and cloudy" and couldn't maintain eye contact well. Throughout the conversation, she looked at the **purple pickled radish**. Or maybe it was the soy sauce.

We made eye contact only in the latter half. When I asked about her longest relationship. Her eyes sparkled most when I said, "I've never dated anyone for more than six months."

I slurped down all my egg custard, but she was still picking at hers. She covered her mouth and gripped her chopsticks **like a fist**. The setting seemed uncomfortable for her. She even left her yellowtail. Left the chirashi too.

I felt a bit guilty for eating so well alone.

Eyes that looked somewhat anxious with little dating experience.

**'As expected, this won't be easy'** — that intuition hit me.

## "Why Don't You Get Stressed?"

She asked me when I feel most stressed.

I thought to myself, 'Work should be energizing, so asking this question means someone must be stressing her out.'

Sure enough, a colleague teacher stresses her out. And she wants to change jobs.

When I work, I'm energetic and have a clear **0-or-1 binary personality**.

She seemed to think I don't get stressed.

Actually, I get stressed by people who just **whine** about quitting their job but never act. I prefer **action-oriented people (not demanding)**. I dislike being lukewarm.

When people ask "Why don't you get stressed?", it actually stresses me out. If they ask what stresses me, should I say "Hearing people complain about stress"?

## Life's Chapter 2, The Marriage Quest

"Why do you want to get married?"

**Solo life holds no more mysteries for me.**

Friends are clearing quests in **Chapter 2 (marriage/parenting)** of life, while I'm still stuck in Chapter 1.

In RPG terms, I've cleared all side quests in Chapter 1 and leveled up sufficiently. Now I want to move to the next chapter, but I need a partner to start the **main quest (marriage)**.

"When did you want to get married?"

I answered it's already passed. I wanted to in my early 30s, which is exactly her age now.

Wanting it doesn't make it happen though.

## Pancake House, Full but Still

We looked for the nearest cafe for the second round. Right next door was a place selling pancakes and coffee.

"Can we just have coffee?"

The staff said we need to order food. Too full, but it's close, so let's go in!

The pancakes are good though... too full to enjoy them with honey.

Plus, there was a lively group at the next table, making conversation difficult. They were talking about **loans and house hunting**, which scattered my focus.

We almost immediately got up to walk for digestion.

## Under Lotte Tower, Gloomy November

Walking under Lotte Tower, the weather was gloomy.

The rain had stopped, but men in coats walking around with their partners, **black umbrellas** unfurled, made me feel more alone.

Then we toured the renewed Jamsil Station underground.

Candle decorations at Zara Home.
Harry Potter pop-up.
Lego shop selling Pokémon Eevee.
Apple Store that replaced Hollister.

My eyes kept drifting to the **spaces** rather than her.

Why do I remember the Byredo and Café Lowaide pop-ups more?

'Lowaide made it all the way here.'

## Blind Dates Are Like Reading Books

People ask me. Isn't it exhausting, going on all these blind dates?

I've thought about it before, and blind dates are a lot like **reading books**.

Some books have stunning covers but turn out to be hollow inside, so you put them down. Others look plain on the outside, but once you start reading, they're overflowing with insight — the kind you can't put down.

Going through new introductions every time,
asking about ideal types,
aligning hobbies —
isn't that exhausting?

It is. It is, but it isn't.

Because it's a journey of exploring **universes that don't exist in mine**. A space-time expedition into parallel worlds where I wonder — if I'd made different choices years ago, could I have entered that universe?

And if it were easy to find her, I might take the meeting lightly. But I know the reward that comes after this struggle.

## Optimal Stopping Theory: The 37% Rule

There's something called **Optimal Stopping Theory**. Also known as the 'Secretary Problem' in mathematics.

If I need to hire a secretary and plan to interview 10 candidates, I should automatically pass on the first **1/e ≈ roughly 37% (3.7 people)** — no matter how good they are. Instead, this phase is for calibrating my standards. After that, I pick the first person who exceeds those standards — and mathematically, this gives the **highest probability of making the optimal choice**.

That's how you calibrate your baseline. No regrets, sharper eyes.

But me… I've recalibrated way too many times. My standards are clear. The 37% I passed on? Try 300. Just kidding. Anyway, I do have a clear **filter** now.

The problem is, the clearer that filter gets, the less I want to explore. And even when I do explore, I keep making the same mistake — **not trusting the first 15 seconds, looking deeper, and then confirming what I already knew**.

## I've Lost Count of Which Page of Chapter 1 This Is

Waiting for Chapter 2, I write yet another page of Chapter 1 — not even sure which page number this is anymore.
