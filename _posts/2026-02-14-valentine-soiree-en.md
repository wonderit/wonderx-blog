It was Valentine's Day.

The air felt different from the morning — or maybe I just wanted it to. Either way, it was February 14th, and I was standing outside a café near Hangangjin Station.

---

I arrived a little early. I sat by the window and looked outside. The winter sunlight was warmer than expected.

Then she came.

A sky-blue hooded knit cardigan under a bright coat. The layers looked effortless, like someone walking between seasons. As soon as she sat down, she said:

"The upper part of your face looks just like my dad!"

The upper face — forehead, the space between the brows. That's where she saw her father.

I paused.

Before I could figure out if it was a compliment, a greeting, or some kind of signal — she was already onto the next sentence. Someone who brings up her father within minutes of meeting a stranger. Someone for whom that comes naturally.

I liked that.

---

There are people who say, when asked about their ideal type: "Someone like my dad." I used to let that pass. But lately, I hear it differently. Someone who trusts their father. Someone who learned what respect looks like. Someone who carries that feeling naturally into love.

Too subtle to call it a green flag. But it was something.

---

The conversation went deeper than I expected.

What is love. What is dating. What kind of person should you marry.

Her eyebrows were bleached. Behind her colored lenses, her eyes had a brightness to them. She said she changes her hair color often for shoots. She said she loves golf.

I tend to think about golf and life at the same time.

Golf is numbers. When the numbers are good, you feel good. When they're bad, you don't. It works, then it doesn't, then it works again — just like life. One round together and you'll see someone's full range of emotions. That's why I've always wondered why dating shows include family dinners but never a round of golf.

"Next time, let's go to a par-3 course or a screen golf place."

The thought came before the words did.

She came back from the restroom holding something.

Two Deux Chocolat choux.

Valentine's Day, she said. She'd bought them earlier and brought one for me. She thought of it. She followed through. She handed it over like it was the most natural thing in the world.

I was moved. Quietly, but completely.

5 PM. A Western restaurant near Apgujeong Rodeo Station.

The May's 10:10 rotation matchmaking party. We'd connected through a previous networking event called 'Luca', and were invited here.

The setup: 2-on-2, five tables, thirty minutes each, two and a half hours total.

The night before, I happened to watch a YouTube video — a debate between a divorce attorney and the founder of a matchmaking agency, discussing ideal types and marriage. The founder turned out to be from The May. One thing he said stayed with me: people who list their ideal type as a checklist often feel nothing when they actually meet someone who checks every box. Marriage, ultimately, is about finding someone to build a life with.

That line was still somewhere in the back of my head.

First table. Someone caught my eye. I was still warming up — kept my words measured. But her gaze was alive. Three years younger, I think. Softer and more open than most women in their thirties tend to be these days.

Second table. A familiar face from the previous networking event. Seeing someone a second time confirmed what I suspected: if my heart didn't move the first time, it rarely moves the second. The person next to her had a kind of aesthetic profession I don't have, and the conversation was interesting. But the timer moved us on.

Third table, fourth — somewhere in there I thought: wouldn't 1-on-1 for fifteen minutes have been better?

Fifth table. Last one.

By then, I'd given up filtering. I just talked. It came out more naturally. She laughed, and a tiny drop of something appeared at the edge of her nose. We both laughed at that.

After the event, someone proposed a second round. We had prior commitments. When we bowed out, one of the women said, "Then let's just go, us two." We'd been rejected together.

---

On the way home, I selected two: the first table and the second.

About marriage — I've thought about it this way: if I'm a company, my parents are shareholders. I'd rather bring home someone who introduces naturally than have to build a full presentation to convince the board. Standing against their wishes is never just about two people.

That's not wrong, exactly.

But tonight, for the first time, I wondered whether that framework is a wall I've quietly been building around myself.

Ten short story collections read.

Two set aside on the far left.

I came home.

Today was Valentine's Day.
